Anki 2.1.55 or higher is required for the most recent version of this add-on to work.

<b id="usage">USAGE</b>

<b id="creating--editing">Creating / Editing</b>

The note type is automatically added the first time you start Anki after installing the add-on.

When creating cards, write a &quot;1&quot; for correct choices or a &quot;0&quot; for incorrect choices in the &quot;Answers&quot; field.
The question type can be selected with the field &quot;QType&quot;.
It can be either 0 (Kprim), 1 (Multiple Choice) or 2 (Single Choice).
The Screenshots section shows how the question types look.
These values in the &quot;Answer&quot; field must be separated by a single space.
The order and number of values in the &quot;Answer&quot; field must correspond with the choices &quot;Q_1&quot; to &quot;Q_5&quot;.
If you don't need all the choices, just leave the remaining &quot;Q_&quot; fields blank and only enter as many values as you need in the &quot;Answers&quot; field.

<b id="reviewing">Reviewing</b>

Select the correct and incorrect choices accordingly and click &quot;Show Answer&quot;.
The add-on will automatically style your choices based on whether you answered correctly or not.

<b id="addon-config">Addon Config</b>

If you want to change the way your answers are styled (e.g. color green what you should have chosen instead of what
you have chosen correctly) you can use the addon's config to switch between different styles:

Great work Simon!

He also reworked my card templates into one single all-in-one template.
Thanks a lot!
